The plan balances rigorous evaluation with meaningful engagement, ensuring that the testing process itself becomes a form of ecological reconnection. By documenting both quantitative metrics and qualitative stories, we'll gather the insights needed to refine MYCELIUM into a powerful tool for healing our relationship with the living world.
