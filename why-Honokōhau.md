# MYCELIUM: Reconnecting People to Honokōhau Valley

## The Problem We're Solving

Imagine living next to one of the most beautiful watersheds in the world—Honokōhau Valley in West Maui—but experiencing it only through occasional hikes or glimpses from a distance. Despite our physical proximity to this incredible place, many of us have lost our deep connection to the land. We may not notice the subtle changes in stream flow, the decline of native birds, or the health of the forest until dramatic problems emerge.

This disconnection isn't just sad—it's dangerous. When we can't feel the health of our watershed, we miss early warning signs of environmental problems that affect our water, our food, our safety from floods, and the cultural heritage that makes Maui special.

Most critically, this disconnect has allowed large commercial interests to divert and exploit water resources with minimal community oversight. For generations, plantation-era water diversions have redirected stream flow away from Honokōhau Valley, threatening traditional practices, ecosystem health, and community water security. Without community-based monitoring and a shared understanding of the valley's water resources, corporate interests continue to make decisions about our water with little transparency or accountability.

## What if You Could Feel the Valley's Health?

MYCELIUM transforms your relationship with Honokōhau Valley by letting you physically *feel* what's happening in the watershed. This isn't just data on a screen—it's a direct, embodied experience of the place that sustains us.

Imagine:

* Feeling a gentle tightening sensation in your wrist when the stream flow drops too low during dry periods
* Experiencing a rhythmic pulse that matches the richness of bird song in the native forest
* Sharing these sensations with friends and neighbors during a "collective pulse," where everyone simultaneously feels what's happening in the watershed

This isn't science fiction. Using simple, wearable technology connected to environmental sensors throughout the valley, MYCELIUM translates ecological data into physical sensations you can feel. It's like having a sixth sense that extends beyond your body to include the ʻāina (land) itself.

## Why Honokōhau Valley Needs This Now

Honokōhau Valley faces urgent challenges:

* Historical and ongoing water diversions by large agricultural corporations reducing stream flow
* Lack of transparent data about actual water extraction volumes and impacts
* Corporate control of water systems with minimal community oversight or input
* Decreasing stream flow affecting both ecosystem health and traditional cultural practices
* Invasive species threatening native plants and animals
* Erosion and sediment runoff damaging coral reefs downstream
* Disconnection between generations about caring for this special place

Traditional monitoring methods are important but insufficient. Numbers on a spreadsheet don't create the emotional connection needed for sustained action, nor do they provide the continuous, accessible evidence needed to challenge corporate water diversions. MYCELIUM bridges this gap by making ecological health personally meaningful, immediate, and shareable, while also creating an independent community-based monitoring system that can document impacts of water diversion and extraction.

## How It Works in Simple Terms

1. **Environmental Sensors**: We place small, unobtrusive sensors throughout Honokōhau Valley to monitor stream flow, rainfall, forest health, and other key indicators.

2. **Translation Layer**: Our software converts this environmental data into patterns that can be felt through simple wearable devices (similar to how a smartwatch can vibrate in different patterns).

3. **Wearable Feedback**: Community members wear comfortable bands that deliver these gentle sensations, giving them an ongoing "sense" of the valley's health.

4. **Community Interface**: A simple app connects people to share observations, plan restoration activities, and participate in "collective pulse" experiences where everyone feels the same aspect of the watershed together.

## Real Benefits for Real People

* Connect classroom learning with physical understanding
* Participate in citizen science that helps the community
* Learn about water rights, justice and civic engagement

## What Makes This Different

MYCELIUM isn't just another environmental monitoring project. It's fundamentally different because:

1. **It's Embodied**: You don't just look at data—you feel it physically.

2. **It's Communal**: Experiences are shared, creating collective awareness and action.

3. **It's Culturally Rooted**: The system honors traditional Hawaiian connections to land while using modern technology.

4. **It's Actionable**: Every sensation leads to practical opportunities for care and restoration.

5. **It's Independent**: Unlike monitoring controlled by the same companies diverting the water, MYCELIUM puts data collection in community hands.

6. **It's Transparent**: All community members can literally feel what's happening, making it impossible to hide impacts of water extraction.

7. **It's Evidential**: The system creates an ongoing record of water conditions that can be used in regulatory proceedings and water rights cases.

## Stories of Possibility

Imagine these scenarios becoming reality:

> **Kupuna (Elder) Connection**: Uncle Keali'i, who grew up in Honokōhau Valley before moving to town, wears his MYCELIUM band daily. One morning, he feels an unusual pattern indicating low stream flow, prompting him to call his grandson. Together, they visit the valley, discovering a blockage of invasive plants. They organize a community workday to restore proper flow, reconnecting to a practice their ancestors performed for generations.

> **Youth Leadership**: Students at Lahainaluna High School form a MYCELIUM club, taking responsibility for monitoring the upper watershed. When their bands indicate a change in forest health, they organize field studies, discovering a new patch of invasive species. Working with conservation professionals, they develop an eradication plan, becoming recognized experts in forest restoration.

> **Cultural Revival**: During a drought period, community members feel increasing water stress patterns. This prompts cultural practitioners to share traditional practices for water conservation and forest protection. The community organizes a ceremony at the headwaters, followed by restoration work that integrates traditional knowledge with modern conservation techniques.

> **Water Justice**: During a water commission hearing, community members present a year's worth of MYCELIUM data showing how corporate diversions affect stream flow in real-time. The continuous monitoring reveals that the company has been taking far more water than reported, particularly during dry periods. This evidence, felt and verified by dozens of community members, leads to a landmark decision requiring the return of minimum flow standards to Honokōhau Stream.

> **Corporate Accountability**: When a large agricultural operation claims their water extraction has "no significant impact" on stream health, the community shares MYCELIUM data showing precisely when diversions occur and how they affect downstream conditions. The company, faced with community-verified evidence, agrees to modify their practices and restore partial flow during critical dry periods.

## Our Implementation Plan

We've developed a 17-week implementation plan that includes:

1. **Community Engagement**: Working with cultural practitioners, local residents, and organizations already active in West Maui

2. **Sensor Deployment**: Placing environmental monitoring equipment throughout the valley

3. **Bioregional Bonding**: A guided experience connecting people to different parts of the valley

4. **Individual and Collective Experiences**: Both personal awareness and shared community experiences
