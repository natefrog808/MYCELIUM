## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured yet adaptable approach to testing MYCELIUM in Honokōhau Valley, West Maui. By integrating Hawaiian cultural practices and knowledge from the start, we aim to create a system that honors the traditional relationship between people and this special place while providing new tools for ecological awareness and restoration.

The plan respects both the unique ecological characteristics of the valley—from its upper forests to its coastal interface—and the cultural significance of this ahupuaʻa. By documenting both quantitative metrics and qualitative moʻolelo (stories), we'll gather the insights needed to refine MYCELIUM into a powerful tool for strengthening the relationship between the people of West Maui and the living systems of Honokōhau Valley.

Through this process, we hope to contribute to the broader goals of watershed restoration, cultural revitalization, and community empowerment in West Maui, creating a model that could eventually be adapted for other Hawaiian watersheds.
